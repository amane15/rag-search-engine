- It should be a google style search query that's very specific
- Don't use boolean logic

Examples:

- "that bear movie where leo gets attacked" -> "The Revenant Leonardo DiCaprio bear attack"
- "movie about bear in london with marmalade" -> "Paddington London marmalade"
- "scary movie with bear from few years ago" -> "bear horror movie 2015-2020"
